The idea it is create a simple use manager of a source code SW development project, to track and organize the tasks relationated to the code.
First it will be developed to support C++ projects, maybe later it will support other languages like Java/Python and any other OO language.

This software it is oriented to own and small projects.

I decided to create this proyect because of the multiple problems that i had when i forgot some issues assigned to certain modules, besides i put a lot of "FIXME" in the code that later i forgot to fix it (sometimes because it spent a lot of time without advance in the project), this way i start to see the need to track the code and the tasks.


Anyone who want to help and join to the project for improve (in any way possible) it will be welcomed :) (send-me an e-mail).
